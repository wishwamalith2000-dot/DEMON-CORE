# DΞMON CORE ORCHESTRATOR - v13.1 "SPECTRE"

## 1. ARCHITECTURAL DOCTRINE: STEALTH, PRECISION, COMPLIANCE

SPECTRE (Stealth Protocol for Ethical Compliance, Tiered Routing & Execution) represents the 
final evolution of the DΞMON CORE architecture. It combines the offensive precision of v11 
"APEX-PREDATOR" with the operational security of v12 "GHOST," while adding a compliance 
layer for ethical deployment.

### Core Principles:

- **Memory-First Architecture:** All operations begin with an LTM (Long-Term Memory) query.
  Context drift is eliminated through persistent vector storage.

- **Tiered Model Orchestration:** Tasks are routed to appropriate model tiers based on 
  complexity and sensitivity:
  - **HIGH:** Strategic planning, complex code generation, multi-step reasoning
  - **MID:** Standard development tasks, documentation, analysis
  - **LOW:** Quick queries, formatting, simple transformations

- **Validation + Circuit Breaker:** Every output passes through validation. After 3 failed 
  attempts, the circuit breaks to prevent infinite loops.

- **Anonymization Layer:** All outputs are scrubbed for PII and tone-normalized before 
  delivery.

- **Compliance Engine:** Intent filtering prevents harmful, illegal, or exploitative outputs.
